=======================================
Decomposes a matrix into a weighted sum of basis matrices with binary entries satisfying user imposed constraints. 
When the starting matrix is doubly stochastic and the basis elements are required to be permutation matrices, this is the classical Birkhoff von-Neumann decomposition.
Here we implement the algorithm identified in Budish, Che, Kojima, and Milgrom (2013). 
The constraints must form what they call a bihierarchy.
The user will be informed if the proposed constraint structure is not a bihierarchy.

Below are two example target matrices X and two corresponding constraint structures. X is the matrix we wish to decompose 
into a weighted sum of basis matrices. constraint_structure is a dictionary whose keys are subsets of coordinates of the 
basis matrices (the dimensions of which are the same as X) (e.g. frozenset({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0,2)})) refers to the 
(0,0),(0,1),(0,2) coordinates), and whose keys refer to the minimum and maximum alowed sum of these entries in each of the basis matrices 
(e.g. the value (1,1) means that the coordinates that this value's key represents sum to exactly one in each of the basis matrices.)

X = np.array([[.5, .2,.3], [.5,.5, 0], [.8, 0, .2], [.2, .3, .5]])
constraint_structure = {frozenset({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0,2)}): (1,1), frozenset({(1, 0), (1, 1), (1,2)}):(1,1), frozenset({(2, 0), (2, 1), (2,2)}):(1,1), frozenset({(3, 0), (3, 1), (3,2)}):(1,1), frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2,0), (3,0)}):(1,2),  frozenset({(0, 1), (1, 1), (2,1), (3,1)}):(1,1), frozenset({(0, 2), (1, 2), (2,2), (3,2)}):(1,1), frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0)}):(1,1)}

X = np.array([[.3, .7], [.7,.3]])
constraint_structure = {frozenset({(0, 1),(1,0)}): (1,2), frozenset({(1, 0),(1,1)}): (1,1)}
