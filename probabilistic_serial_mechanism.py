=======================================
Runs the probabilistic serial mechanism, taking as input a dictionary R. 
A key of this dictionary corresponds to an agent,
a value the agent's rank order list of the objects. 
Output is a dictionary P. 

A value of the output dictionary is a list whose entries are probabilities that the agent wins the 
corresponding objects.
E.g. for the dictionary R = {0: [0,1,2], 1: [2,1,0]}, there are two agents and three objects. 
Agent 1 ranks object 2 above object 1 above object 0. 
Output for this dictionary is P = {0: array([ 1. ,  0.5,  0. ]), 1: array([ 0. ,  0.5,  1. ])}. 
Agent 0 wins object 0 with probability 1 and object 1 with probability 0.5.
